# wisp
wisp is a DotA 2 Discord bot helper that provides some basic analysis over played matches, players and more.

The bot is written in Python and can be easily hosted by whoever wants, by following the steps described in the **how to host** section.

The project relies on the [Steam Web API](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API) and [OpenDota API](https://www.opendota.com/), so any issues you may experience may be caused due to the problems with these information providers.

## How to host
It's empty for now.
