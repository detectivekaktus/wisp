***THE PROJECT IS NO LONGER MAINTAINED***

wisp is a DotA 2 Discord bot helper that provides some basic analysis over played matches, players and more.

The project relies on the [Steam Web API](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_Web_API) and [OpenDota API](https://www.opendota.com/), so any issues you may experience may be caused due to the problems with these data providers.
